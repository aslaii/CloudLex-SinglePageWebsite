# Jericho De Leon Bermas's Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my portfolio website. This is a simple, single-page website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the website.
- `styles.css`: Contains all the styles for the website.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for the website. Including Typed.JS and Space Elevator Background Javascript.

## Usage

To view the website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Start a local server (I am using Python's built-in HTTP server).
4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Features

- An about section with my name and background information.
- A skills section highlighting my programming skills
- An education section displaying my academic qualifications.
- A contact section with links to my LinkedIn profile and email address.

## Libraries Used
